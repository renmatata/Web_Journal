        <div class="text"></div><p><h3 style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">DEFINITION:</h3> Internet of things is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables this objects to collect and exchange data. <br>
            <br><h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">ADVANTAGES OF IOT</h3>
            <h4>Real-Time Access to Information</h4>
            - One of the primary internet of things advantages is the uninterrupted flow of
            information. Internet-connected devices can share data at the speed of light,
            which means fewer delays and a lower potential for miscommunication. 

            <h4>Emerging Businesses</h4>
             - The rise of new technology always brings an explosion of new business
            opportunities, and IoT is no different. Although smart devices have long
            penetrated almost every aspect of society, we are still years, or perhaps
            decades away from widespread global use.

            <h4>Advanced Data Collection</h4>
            - The Internet of things provides excellent opportunities for data collection
            and business growth. Deployed across a wide range of devices, the internet of
            things advantages of data collection can help business owners make decisions
            on a macro scale as well as a granular level. <br>

            <h4>Improved Efficiency</h4>
            - By its very definition, the Internet of Things operates without human
            intervention. It is a system relying solely on machine-to-machine
            communication, with data logged and collected in real-time, at any time of
            day or night. One of the most significant impacts of such a system is the
            increased efficiency of a wide range of services. <br>

            <h4>Higher Productivity</h4>
            - The Internet of Things can also improve efficiency and productivity at work
            and in the industrial sector, similar to how voice-activated Amazon and Google
            products increase efficiency at home. <br>

            <h4>Improved Quality of Life</h4>
             - Improved quality of life from IoT networks doesn’t only apply to individuals.
            Smart devices could benefit entire communities, with internet-connected
            traffic sensors and lights easing congestion in heavily populated areas, for
            example. <br>

            <h4>Health and Safety</h4>
             - Technological and medical advances have enabled more humans to reach old
            age, but these boundaries are being pushed further every year. In a medical
            emergency, every second could mean the difference between life and death,
            and the highly interconnected world of IoT could bring about a plethora of
            benefits. <br></p>

            <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">DISADVANTAGES OF IOT</h3>
            <h3>High Internet Dependency</h3>

            — IoT systems cannot function without the internet, so it is impossible to have
            a reliable IoT ecosystem without a stable internet connection. <br>

            <h3>No International Standardization</h3>

            — As IoT compatibility is not standardized internationally, devices produced by
            different manufacturers could have trouble communicating with one another
            most effectively. <br>

            <h3>Chance of System-Wide Corruption</h3>

            — A single bug or malware attack could potentially bring down the entire
            system. <br>

            <h3>Relative Complexity</h3>
            — Design, development, implementation, and maintenance of an extensive
            IoT ecosystem is a relatively complex endeavor. <br>

            <h3>Potential for Increased Unemployment Rates</h3>
            — Workers in specific fields could run a higher risk of being replaced by AI.
            Production line robots, smart surveillance systems, self-driving vehicles, and
            other machines will replace humans in these positions. <br>

            <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
            — If not operated carefully, an IoT system could provide critical data to third
            parties. Also, since IoT systems are interconnected through various networks,
            there’s a real risk of network attacks if the highest security measures are not
            employed. <br>
            <h3>Reduced Mental and Physical Activity</h3>
            — It can make people ignorant because they solely rely on smart
            devices instead of doing the work by themselves, this cause them to
            become inactive and lethargic. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">HOW DOES IOT WORKS?</h3>
            An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that
            use embedded processors, sensors and communication hardware
            to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their
            environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by
            connecting to an IoT gateway or another edge device where data is
            either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. <br>
