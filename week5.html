    <div class="section2">
        <p><h3 style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">DEFINITION:</h3> 
            Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.<br>
            <br><h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost-effective: Cloud computing eliminates the need for businesses to purchase and
                    maintain expensive hardware, reducing costs associated with IT infrastructure.</li><br>
                <li>Scalability: With cloud computing, businesses can easily scale their resources up or
                    down depending on their needs. This allows them to avoid overprovisioning and
                    underprovisioning resources.</li><br>
                <li>Flexibility: Cloud computing allows employees to work from anywhere with an internet
                    connection, increasing flexibility and mobility.</li><br>
                <li>Disaster recovery: Cloud providers have extensive disaster recovery capabilities built-in,
                    making it easy to recover from disasters like data breaches, natural disasters, and power outages.</li><br>
                <li>Automatic updates: Cloud providers automatically update software and security, saving businesses
                    time and ensuring they always have access to the latest features and
                    protections.</li><br>
                <li>Variability: the changing nature of the data companies seek to capture, manage and analyze </li><br>
            </ul>
            <h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">DISADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Security:Cloud computing involves storing data and running applications over the internet, which can make businesses vulnerable to security breaches and cyber attacks.</li><br>
                <li>Dependence on internet connectivity: Cloud computing requires a reliable internet connection to access data and applications. If the internet goes down, businesses may experience downtime and loss of productivity.</li><br>
                <li>Limited control: With cloud computing, businesses must rely on their cloud provider for
                    support, which can limit their control over their resources.</li><br>
                <li>Compliance and regulatory issues: Some industries have strict compliance and regulatory requirements that may be difficult to meet with cloud computing.</li><br>
                <li>Cost uncertainty: While cloud computing can be cost-effective in the long run, it can be difficult to  predict the exact costs of cloud services, especially when businesses need to scale their resources up or down.</li><br>

</div>
<div class="section5">
    <p><h3 style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">DEFINITION:</h3> 
        Is a type of computing that relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform operations on data. In contrast to classical computers, which use binary digits (bits) to represent information, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits), which can represent a combination of states simultaneously, allowing for exponentially faster computations.<br>
        <br><h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">QUBITS</h3>
        is short for a sequence of quantum bits. With a classic computer, data is stored in tiny transistors that hold a single bit of information, either the binary value of 1 or 0. With a quantum computer, the data is stored in qubits.
        </p>
    <p>
        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">ADVANTAGES OF QUANTUM COMPUTING</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Speed: Quantum computers can perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.</li>
            <li>Parallelism: Quantum computers can perform many calculations simultaneously due to the nature of quantum bits, or qubits.</li>
            <li>Quantum simulation: Quantum computers can simulate quantum systems in a way that classical computers cannot. This has implications for applications in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.</li>
            <li>Optimization: Quantum computers can solve certain optimization problems more efficiently than classical computers.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">DISADVANTAGES OF QUANTUM COMPUTING</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Error correction:Quantum computers are highly susceptible to errors due to environmental interference, and error correction is a major challenge in quantum computing. This means that the reliability and accuracy of quantum computations is a major concern.</li>
            <li>Limited functionality: Quantum computers are not able to perform all types of computations. They are
                specialized for certain types of problems, and are not as versatile as classical computers.</li>
            <li>Cost: Quantum computers are currently very expensive to build and maintain, and the
                technology is not yet widely available. This limits their accessibility and applicability.</li>
            <li>Complexity: Quantum computing is a highly complex field, and requires specialized
                knowledge and expertise to develop and operate quantum computers.</li>

</div>
<div class="section9">
    <p><h3 style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">DEFINITION:</h3> 
        - An embedded system is a small computer that forms part of a larger system, device or machine. Its purpose is to control the device and to allow a user to interact with it. Embedded systems tend to have one, or a limited number of tasks that they can perform.<br>
        <br><h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">CHARACTERISTICS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-functioned − An embedded system usually performs a specialized operation and does the same repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Tightly constrained − All computing systems have constraints on design metrics, but those on an embedded system can be especially tight.</li>
            <li>Reactive and Real time- Many embedded systems must continually react to changes in the system's
                environment and must compute certain results in real time without any
                delay.</li>
            <li>Microprocessors based- It must be microprocessor or microcontroller based.</li>
            <li>Memory- It must have a memory, as its software usually embeds in ROM. It does not need any
                secondary memories in the computer.</li>
            <li>Connected- It must have connected peripherals to connect input and output devices.</li>
            <li>HW-SW systems- Software is used for more features and flexibility. Hardware is used for performance and security.</li>
