            Technology that combines virtual information with the real world.

            It uses Multimedia, 3d Modeling, real-time tracking and registration, Intelligent interaction, sensing andmore.

            Applies computer-generated virtual information such as text, image, video, etc. to the real world after simulation.<br>

            <h4>Digital Reality</h4>
            -Digital reality refers to the widespectrum of technologies andaffordances that include AugmentedReality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Realitythat simulate reality in various ways. 

            <h4>Virtual Reality</h4>
            -A combination of real scene viewed by a uservand virtual scene generated by a computer that augments the scene with an additional information.

            <h4>Mixed Reality</h4>
            Virtual reality means feeling the imaginary(virtual world) world, rather than the real one. The imaginary world is a simulation running in a computer. Virtual reality is the term used for computer generated 3D environments that allow the user to enter and interact with alternate realities. <br>

            <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">ARCHITECTURE OF AR SYSTEM</h3>
            <h3>Device</h3>

            This component is responsible for creation, display and interaction of 3D models. The device can be portal or in static state. Example, mobile, computer, AR headsets etc. <br>

            <h3>Virtual Content</h3>

            The virtual content is nothing but the 3D model created or generated by the system or AR application.Virtual content is type of information that can be integrated in real world user’s environment. This Virtual content can be 3D models, texture, text, images etc. <br>

            <h3>Tracking</h3>

            This component is basically process which make spossible creation of AR models. Tracking is sort of algorithm which help to determine the device where toplace or integrate the 3D model in real world environment. There are many types of Trackin algorithm available which can be used in development of AR applications. <br>

            <h3>Real-life Entity</h3>
            The last component AR architecture is real world entities. This entities can be tree, book, fruits, computer or anything which is visible in screen. AR application does not change position of real life entity. It only integrate the digital information with this entities. <br>

            <h3>Entity</h3>
            Augmented reality in education can serve a number of purposes. It helps the students easily acquire, process, and remember the information. Additionally, AR makes learning itself more engaging and fun. AR can enable teachers to show virtual examples of concepts and add gaming elements to provide textbook material support. This will enable students to learn faster and memorize information. <br>
