             A field of research and innovation concerned with building ‘things’- generally, materials and devices – on the scale for industrial purposes.<br>
            <br><h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">APPLICATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Medicine: customized nanoparticles the size of molecules that can deliver  drugs directly to diseased cells in your body. When it’s perfected, this method should greatly reduce the damage treatment such as chemotherapy does to a  patient’s healthy cells.</li><br>
                <li>Electronics: it has some answers for how we might increase the capabilities of electronics devices while we reduce their weight and power consumption.</li><br>
                <li>Food: it has an impact on several aspects of food science, from how food is grown to how it is packaged. Companies are developing nanomaterials that will make a difference not only in the taste of food but also in food safety and the health benefits that food delivery.</li><br>
                <li>Agriculture: nanotechnology can possibly change the whole agriculture part and nourishment industry anchor from generation to preservation, handling, bundling, transportation, and even waste treatment.</li><br>
                <li>Vehicle manufacturers: much like aviation, lighter and stronger materials will be valuable for making vehicles that are both quicker and more secure.</li><br>

    <p><h3 style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">DEFINITION:</h3>
        It is the broad area of biology involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use".<br>
        <br><h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">APPLICATION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Agriculture (Green Biotechnology) - Biotechnology had contributed a lot to modify the genes of the organism known as Genetically Modified Organisms such as Crops, Animals, Plants, Fungi, Bacteria, etc. Genetically modified crops are formed by the manipulation of DNA to introduce a new trait into the crops. These manipulations are done to introduce traits such as pest resistance, insect resistance, weed resistance, etc.</li><br>
            <li>Medicine (Medicinal Biotechnology) - is defined as the application of biotechnology tools for producing medical products that can be used for the diagnostics, prevention, and treatment of diseases.</li>
            <li>Aquaculture Fisheries - biotechnologies have been used in aquaculture and fisheries include genetic improvements and control of reproduction, biosecurity and disease control, environmental management and bioremediation and biodiversity conservation and fisheries management.</li>
            <li>Environment (Environmental biotechnology) - is used in waste treatment and pollution prevention. Environmental biotechnology can more efficiently clean up many wastes than conventional methods and greatly reduce our dependence on methods for land-based disposal. </li>

</div>
<div class="section7">
    <p><h3 style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">DEFINITION:</h3> 
        A growing list of records, called blocks that are linked using cryptography.<br>
        <br><h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">BLOCKS?</h3>
        “Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital process of information.

        <ol>
            <li>Blocks store information about transactions like date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase.</li>
            <li>Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions.</li>
            <li>Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">3 PILLARS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <h4>1. Decentralization</h4> 
        <p> the information is not stored by one single entity. In fact, everyone in the network owns the information.</p>
        <h4>2. Transparency</h4> 
        <p>blockchain technology provides transparency by allowing all participants in the network to view and verify the data stored on the ledger.</p>
        <h4>3. Immutability</h4> 
        <p> In the context of the blockchain, means that once something has been entered into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.</p>
        
        <h3  style="color: rgb(205, 228, 228);">APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN</h3>
        “Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital process of information.

        <ol>
            <li>Cryptocurrency: Blockchain enables secure, decentralized transactions without the need for a central authority or intermediary.</li>
            <li>Identity Verification: Blockchain can be used to store and verify identities, which can improve security and privacy in areas such as healthcare and financial services.</li>
            <li>Decentralized Storage: Blockchain can be used to create decentralize storage networks, which enable individuals to store and share data securely without the need for a centralized provider.</li>
            <li>Voting System: Blockchain can be used to create secure, transparent voting system that are resistant to fraud and tampering.</li>
            <li>Supply Chain Management: Blockchain can be used to track products through out the supply chain, from raw materials to finish goods.</li>
